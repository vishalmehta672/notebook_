Foreign key constraints are used to enforce referential integrity between tables in a relational database.\n\nThere are two main types of cascading actions associated with foreign key constraints: ON DELETE and ON UPDATE. These actions define what should happen when a referenced row in the parent table is either deleted or updated.\n\nHere are the common options for cascading actions:\n\nCASCADE:\nON DELETE CASCADE: If a row in the parent table is deleted, all corresponding rows in the child table will be automatically deleted as well.\nON UPDATE CASCADE: If a primary key value in the parent table is updated, all corresponding foreign key values in the child table will be automatically updated.\n\n\nSET NULL:\nON DELETE SET NULL: If a row in the parent table is deleted, the foreign key values in the child table will be set to NULL.\nON UPDATE SET NULL: If a primary key value in the parent table is updated, the corresponding foreign key values in the child table will be set to NULL.\n\n\nSET DEFAULT:\nON DELETE SET DEFAULT: Similar to SET NULL, but instead of setting the foreign key values to NULL, they are set to their default values.\nON UPDATE SET DEFAULT: Similar to SET NULL, but instead of setting the foreign key values to NULL, they are set to their default values.\n\n\nNO ACTION / RESTRICT:\nON DELETE NO ACTION or ON DELETE RESTRICT: The default behavior. If there are dependent rows in the child table, the operation in the parent table is not allowed.\nON UPDATE NO ACTION or ON UPDATE RESTRICT: The same as ON DELETE NO ACTION or ON DELETE RESTRICT, but for updates.\n\nHere's an example of creating a table with a foreign key constraint that includes cascading actions:",
